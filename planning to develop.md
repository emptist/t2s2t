we are planning to develop a cross platform (for mobils phones, ipads, watches and desktops, etc.) app for personalized language training involves conversation between the app and the user heavilly. That is, the app would say something such as ask the user to ask a question, or instruct the user to tell the app something. Both app and user will speak the language under training, that is talk to each other but not write or type to each other. The app will help user to speak correct in that specific language by calling APIs of some large language model. Instead of telling user where the user has been wrong, it leads the user to a correct way of language use. Later the app can do statistics on the progress of user and adjust the training fitting the user much better. Now that you've understand the purpos of the app, you are expected to select a language you're most familiar with which can effectively fufil the needs. The app is simplly a client side app without the needs of a server, and one can syncrorise theire apps running in different instruments by email messages, blue-teeth sharing or any appraoch of sharing among one's own devices. It will be super nice if the language you choose would be within Gleam, Python, Swift or MoonBit. after a language or two is selected, you can start to plan the dev.
